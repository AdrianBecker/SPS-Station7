# SPS: Station 7

**WARNING:** Always review and test any code here before uploading it to a real PLC!

This is an educational project that automates one step of a production line.
The POUs are located in the *lib* folder as .EXP files, which can be imported into *CoDeSys*.
The exports were created with *CoDeSys 2.3.9.62*. If the import doesn’t work, try changing the line endings to CRLF — although the files provided here should already use CRLF.
